Analyzing the NFL punt statistics.

The Challenge
For the 2018 season, the NFL revised their kickoff rules in an effort to reduce the risk of injury during those plays. By examining injury reports, player position and velocity data, and game video, they were able to understand the game-play circumstances that may exacerbate the risk of injury to players.

This comprehensive review showed that over the course of all games during the 2015-2017 seasons, the kickoff represented only six percent of plays but 12 percent of concussions. Players had approximately four times the risk of concussion on returned kickoffs compared to running or passing plays. The changes to the kickoff rule aim to address the components that posed the most risk, like the use of a two-man wedge.

Now, the NFL is challenging Kagglers to help them perform the same examination, this time on punt play rules. They have provided data for all punt plays from the 2016 and 2017 NFL seasons that includes player rosters, on-field position data and video data, including the plays in which a player suffered a concussion.
